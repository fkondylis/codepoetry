turning and turning in the widening gyre
the falcon cannot hear the falconer;
things fall apart; the centre cannot hold
mere anarchy is loosed upon the world
the blood-dimmed tide is loose, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
Surely some revelation is at hand;

SECOND STANZA
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.

The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out

When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi

Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;

A shape with lion body and the head of a man,

A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,

Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it

Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.
